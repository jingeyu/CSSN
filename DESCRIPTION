Description: The R package CSSN implements the two-step algorithm proposed by Jinge Yu and Xiangyu Luo that recovers spatially-varying cell-specific gene co-expression networks for single-cell spatial expression data. The packages aim to provide estimates for cell-specific gene co-expression networks as well as network predictions in tissue locations where cells are missing. CSSN can be installed in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
